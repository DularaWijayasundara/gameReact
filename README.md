I built this project to improve my React coding skills.
GameHub is a cool website where you can find new games to play. You can search by platform, genre, and more.

To get started with GameHub, follow these steps:

a. Clone this repository to your local machine.
b. To install the required dependencies, run `npm install`.
c. Run `npm run dev` to start the web server.
